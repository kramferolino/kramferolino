# üí´ About Me:
Well thank you for your time. I am sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I wanted to say one last thing: There are no shortages of developers for you to interview. However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless, developers with ambition to learn. The best developers aren‚Äôt the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders. It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong. I may not be the most experienced developer that you will interview, but the one thing that you can guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his/her skills every day, play nicely with other developers, and isn‚Äôt so narrow minded in problem solving that he/she isn‚Äôt willing to try new novel ideas. When you hire me, you will rest assured that you won‚Äôt have to micromanage me, you don‚Äôt have to extinguish fires, and in one year, I will be one of your most valuable employees. I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can grow with, and I have chosen your company for this specific reason. You have probably had similar experience in your career when one company allowed you to really have an impact. I am at that stage now, and I look forward to being part of this team. Thank you.
